## Benjamin J. Derieg

I'm currently a first-year physics graduate student at the University of Utah. I got my B.S. from Brigham Young University in 2024, and there my research focused on circumnuclear gas/dust disks in early-type galaxies. Going forward, I'm hoping to apply what I've learned to something broadly in the field of astroparticle physics or astronomy. I love to use Python for whatever it can be used for, but you'll also find me using languages such as Mathematica, IDL, and C++.
